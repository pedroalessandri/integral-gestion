/**
 * Declarative set of Prisma model names that require automatic tenant scoping.
 *
 * A model is in this set if ALL of the following are true:
 *   1. It has a required (non-nullable) `organizationId` column.
 *   2. Rows from different organizations must never be visible to each other.
 *   3. Its `organizationId` is an invariant — it cannot change after creation.
 *
 * Per ADR 0004 D6: this set is maintained manually (not auto-detected via DMMF)
 * because some models have a nullable `organization_id` by design (e.g.
 * `audit.event`), and the decision to scope a model is semantic, not syntactic.
 * When a future ADR adds a new model with `organizationId`, edit this set explicitly.
 *
 * Models NOT in this set (with rationale):
 *   - `Organization`  — IS the tenant root; scoping by org would be circular.
 *   - `User`          — global identity; membership is expressed via UserOrganizationRole.
 *   - `Module`        — global catalog; not per-tenant.
 *   - `Role`          — global auth catalog (auth schema), not per-org.
 *   - `Permission`    — global auth catalog (auth schema), not per-org.
 *   - `RolePermission`— global auth catalog (auth schema), not per-org.
 *   - `AuditEvent`    — audit.event has NULLABLE organization_id by ADR 0003 design;
 *                       scoping it would hide cross-tenant audit records from superadmins
 *                       and break the append-only audit contract.
